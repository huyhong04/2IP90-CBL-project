### Game Description
This game is called "Escapade", a Pac-man inspired game, where the main goal is to reach the end in the fastest time possible,
while avoiding main game elements such as:
- Walls, to stop the player from moving in a certain direction.
- Obstacles, to kill the player upon touch (these don't move).
- Monsters, to kill the player upon touch (these do move).

There are 3 different stages ranging in difficulty, where the stage map differs by its size and the amount of game elements.
In the 'Easy' stage, there are no monsters and very few walls and obstacles. The corresopnding map is of dimension 10x10.
As for the 'Medium' stage, there are now monsters, but the amount of walls and obstacles are still relatively few. The corresponding map is of dimension 20x20.
Lastly, for the 'Hard stage, there are much more walls, obstacles, and monsters. The corresponding map is of dimension 40x40.
